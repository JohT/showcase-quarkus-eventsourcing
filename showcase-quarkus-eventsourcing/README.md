# Showcase for Event Sourcing on Quarkus using AxonFramework and MicroProfile

## Getting started
* Clone or download this repository. 
* Open a terminal/command window.
* Locate the h2 jar in your maven repository, e.g. ```repository/com/h2database/h2/1.4.197/```.
* Start the h2 database server using ```java -cp h2-1.4.197.jar org.h2.tools.Server -tcpAllowOthers```.
* Open another terminal/command window. Don't close the one where the h2 server is running.
* Open the directory where this README.md is located.
* Run the application by using the following command: ```mvn compile quarkus:dev```.
* Open the UI [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* (Optional) Use the postman collection "showcase-quarkus-eventsourcing.postman_collection.json" for service call examples.
* (Optional) Use the unit tests inside the service package to replay nicknames, create new ones or create further accounts.

## Native Image

### Native Image Build

Build a native image with ```mvn package -Pnative```. 
Details see [Building a native executable][QuarkusNativeExecutable].

## Native Image Agent

[GraalVM's][GraalVM] `java` command support additional line commands to gain insights to application that is running
regarding how it can be compiled to a native image. More informations about the `native-image-agent` can be found here:
[Assisted Configuration with Tracing Agent][NativeImageAssistedConfiguration]

### Collect configuration data (manually)
The [GraalVM][GraalVM] java command can be used to collect configuration data for the native image:

```shell
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=native-image,caller-filter-file=native-image-caller-filter-rules.json -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

This is helpful to get a hint on how to configure ```reflection-config.json``` and ```resources-config.json```
These files were created that way.
Ideally, there would be an axon-extension for Quarkus that manages these settings at build time.
  
#### Notice: 
[native-image-caller-filter-rules.json](native-image-caller-filter-rules.json) contains all known reflection calls that are already known and treated by [Quarkus][Quarkus]. Otherwise they would also appear in the reports and make them hard to read and interpretate.

### Collect configuration data (automated)

The maven profile "native-image-agent" is pre-configured to collect configuration data by running
the integration tests with the necessary lineArgs automatically. Use the following command to start it: 

```shell
mvn integration-test --activate-profiles native-image-agent
```

#### Notice:
`JAVA_HOME` needs to be set to the home directory of a graalvm distribution before the maven command is used.
  
### Trace reflection calls
  
The [GraalVM][GraalVM] java command can also be used to generate a trace of all reflection calls:

```shell
$GRAALVM_HOME/bin/java -agentlib:native-image-agent=trace-output=native-image/trace-output.json,caller-filter-file=native-image-caller-filter-rules.json -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
```

### Running integration tests 

As described in [Using GraalVM native-image-agent][UsingNativeImageAgent] it is very helpful to use integration tests and run them [against the running application][QuarkusIntegrationTestsAgainstRunningApplication], that was started by one of the commands above with the native image agent activated. This is much easier than clicking through the application manually. 


## Features
* MicroProfile Standard
* "Reactive" example using server sent events (tested with safari & chrome browser) and axon subscription query
* Replay example. Use REST DELETE ```/nicknames/projection```
* Contains an axon upcaster example
* Works with H2 and PostgreSql. Just switch the regarding comments in ```application.properties``` and ```persistence.xml```.
* Uses flyway for database schema creation and migration. It is configured to work with H2 and PostgreSql.
* Uses [JSON Binding][JSONBinding] to serialize JSON (MicroProfile Standard)
* Uses meta-annotations to decouple [AxonFramework][AxonFramework] from the message api and business code.
* Full-Stack Build configuration including JavaScript Unit Tests with Jasmine, JavaScript minify, ... 
* Continuous Integration using [GitHub Actions][GitHubActions] for a fully automated build including Java and JavaScript Unit Tests, Web Packaging, native image and integration-tests.

## Notes
* Code comments containing the marker ```Note:``` describes thoughts, background information, documented decisions and hints to problems. 
* ```ArchitectureRulesTest``` defines rules to assure low coupling between the business core, axon and microprofile features.
* These rules might seem a bit extreme. Some may even find them to be impractical. After all, this examples shows that it can be done.
* This is just a simple show case, not an full application.
